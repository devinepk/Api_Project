# Api_Project
## About
After my coding bootcamp, I wanted to build a web app that used an api call because it was something I didn't feel very comfortable with.
It displays the following properties from a single API call:
* Photographer name
* Photographer profile
* Photograph download link

## Tools
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) was used for the API call and quote
* [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) is the source of the incredible photos
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is the front-end library I used for design
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) is used for the icons
